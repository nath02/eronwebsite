			Although migraine is most common in women, it can affect people of any age, sex or background. The migraine is often debilitating and causes the sufferer tremendous pain to be unable to go to work, take care of his daily responsibilities, or even get out of bed during the attack. There are many treatments available for migraines, but full cure by drugs for this condition is rare. However, many report a significant improvement in migraine symptoms by healing.
						Migraine attacks are usually characterized by a throbbing or throbbing pain in the head, usually concentrated on one side. Many people with migraine attacks may also experience nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound. These attacks can last for hours or even days, leaving the person almost powerless. For many people, the only way to find relief is to lie quietly in a dark room until the attack passes.
						Some medications may reduce the frequency and / or severity of migraine attacks. In addition, doctors often encourage patients with a history of migraines to avoid triggers, which may include stress, certain odors, certain foods or other environmental factors. During migraine, patients may be able to reduce the pain by taking pain relievers and trying to relax as much as possible.
						Healing is a non-invasive therapeutic technique that may reduce migraine frequency, reduce the severity of migraines or relieve pain during an active migraine attack. Some of the effects of healing that may benefit migraine sufferers include:
						Reducing feelings of stress.Stress is a precursor to headaches for many people suffering from migraines. Reducing stress as much as possible prevents migraine attacks associated with stress. Studies have shown that healing reduces stress and causes feelings of relaxation, which may be very beneficial for people with a migraine tendency.
						Studies have also shown that people with different types of pain may report pain reduction after undergoing healing. Because pain is the defining characteristic of migraines, reduced pain feelings will be beneficial for migraine sufferers.
